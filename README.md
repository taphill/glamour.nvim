# glamour.nvim

A colorscheme for Neovim, written in Lua, that mimics that colors used in the code snippets from the ReactJS docs.

## Requirements

You need to be running Neovim 0.5.0+

## Installation

Install via package manager:
```vim
" If you are using Vim-Plug
Plug 'tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim'
Plug 'taphill/glamour.nvim'
```

```lua
-- If you are using Packer
use 'tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim'
use 'taphill/glamour.nvim'
```

Enable the colorscheme:

```vim 
" Vim-Script:
colorscheme glamour_nvim
```

```lua
-- Lua:
require('colorbuddy').colorscheme('glamour_nvim')
```

## Features

This is currently a work in progress.

At this time I do not plan on adding plugin-specific highlighting, but that could change. If you would like to add those for yourself I would suggest forking this project.

## TODO

Work in progress...
